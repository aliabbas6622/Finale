## Features

- **Automatic Image Generation**: Images are now generated automatically alongside words
- **Cached Images**: Generated images are stored and cached for immediate display
- **Fallback Support**: If ClipDrop fails, the app continues to work without images

The images use an ethereal, dreamy art style that matches the app's aesthetic.
