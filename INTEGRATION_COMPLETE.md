## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Backend

### Frontend

- **UI**: Matches admin panel design (dark/light mode support)

## 📝 Prompt Template Used

```
Generate an abstract, dreamlike image inspired by the imaginary word: "{WORD}". 
The image should be open to multiple interpretations, allowing different viewers 
to see different shapes, objects, or emotions. Avoid clear or literal objects. 
Use a soft, ethereal, mysterious visual style with subtle gradients, blurred 
organic forms, flowing contrast, and atmospheric lighting. The overall mood 
should provoke curiosity and imagination rather than define anything concrete.
Ultra high resolution, cinematic feel, slightly surreal.
```

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Start servers**:
   ```bash
   start.bat
   # OR manually:
   # Terminal 1: npm run server
   # Terminal 2: npm run dev
   ```

2. **Access Admin Panel**:
   - Click "Admin" button in header
